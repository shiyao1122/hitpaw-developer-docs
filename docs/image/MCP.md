# MCP Integration

HitPaw now provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for image and video enhancement workflows. This page focuses on the **image** side of the MCP integration.

This allows LLM clients such as Claude Desktop and Cursor to call HitPaw tools directly instead of integrating the REST API by hand.

Repository:
[HitPaw MCP Server](https://github.com/HitPaw-Official/hitpaw-mcp-server)

## What You Can Do With MCP

With the HitPaw MCP server, an LLM client can:

- select a suitable image model based on the input content
- submit an image enhancement task
- check task status and fetch the result URL
- transfer remote files to OSS before processing
- list available image models and their recommended use cases

The MCP server also supports video enhancement. See the video documentation section for the video-specific workflow.

## Supported Image Tools

The current image MCP workflow is built around these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `photo_enhance` | Submit an image enhancement or super-resolution task |
| `task_status` | Query task progress and retrieve the result URL |
| `oss_transfer` | Transfer a remote file to OSS and get a stable URL |
| `oss_batch_transfer` | Transfer multiple remote files to OSS |
| `list_photo_models` | List image enhancement models and usage guidance |

## Why Use MCP Instead of Calling the API Directly

Use MCP when you want an LLM client to orchestrate the workflow for you.

- It reduces integration work for prompt-driven workflows.
- It lets Claude or Cursor choose a model based on the image type.
- It keeps the enhancement flow inside the AI client your team already uses.

Use the REST API directly when you are building a product-side integration, backend service, or custom application logic.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set your API key

The MCP server uses the same HitPaw API key as the standard API.

```bash
export HITPAW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Optional:

```bash
export HITPAW_API_BASE_URL=https://api-base.hitpaw.com
```

### 2. Run the MCP server

Recommended:

```bash
npx @hitpaw/mcp-server
```

You can also install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @hitpaw/mcp-server
hitpaw-mcp-server
```

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hitpaw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hitpaw/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HITPAW_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "HITPAW_API_BASE_URL": "https://api-base.hitpaw.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving the configuration.

## Cursor Configuration

Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hitpaw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@hitpaw/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HITPAW_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "HITPAW_API_BASE_URL": "https://api-base.hitpaw.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflow

Typical prompt flow:

1. The user shares an image URL with Claude or Cursor.
2. The client calls `list_photo_models` to determine the best model.
3. The client calls `photo_enhance` with the selected model.
4. The client calls `task_status` until the result is ready.
5. The client returns the enhanced image URL.

Example request in natural language:

```text
Please enhance this image and preserve natural facial texture:
https://example.com/photo.jpg
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HITPAW_API_KEY` | Yes | None | HitPaw API key |
| `HITPAW_API_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api-base.hitpaw.com` | API service base URL |

## When To Use MCP

MCP is a good fit when:

- you want to trigger image enhancement from Claude or Cursor
- your workflow is prompt-first rather than app-first
- you want model selection and task polling handled by the AI client

If you are integrating HitPaw into your own product or backend, start with the [API Reference](./API-reference.md) instead.
