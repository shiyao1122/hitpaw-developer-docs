# Benchmark Overview

This page summarizes representative benchmark results for the HitPaw Image Enhancement API. It is intended as a technical reference for developers who want to understand where different model families perform best.

For endpoint details and request examples, see the [API Reference](./API-reference.md). For model behavior and visual examples, see [Available Models](./available-models.md).

## What This Page Covers

The benchmark notes below focus on three common evaluation needs:

- Extreme upscaling on degraded inputs
- Recovery quality on real-world noisy images
- Structural stability on geometry-heavy scenes

These results are useful when choosing between generative restoration models and more conservative enhancement models.

## Key Takeaways

- `generative_4x` is the strongest option in this set when the input is severely degraded and needs aggressive 4x reconstruction.
- `face_v2_2x` is the more texture-faithful portrait option when natural facial detail matters more than soft beautification.
- Different datasets stress different capabilities, so model selection should follow the actual failure mode of the source image rather than a single global score.

## Benchmark Highlights

### 4x Super-Resolution on Challenging Inputs

The table below compares HitPaw `generative_4x` against Real-ESRGAN on three representative datasets.

| Dataset Context | Baseline (Real-ESRGAN) | HitPaw (`generative_4x`) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DIV2K** (complex textures) | 17.30 PSNR | **21.70 PSNR** | **+4.40 dB (+25.4%)** |
| **RealSR** (real-world noise) | 22.49 PSNR | **26.84 PSNR** | **+4.35 dB** |
| **Urban100** (geometric lines) | 21.05 PSNR | **22.99 PSNR** | **+1.94 dB** |

Interpretation:

- On heavily degraded 4x tasks, `generative_4x` shows the largest gain on texture-rich and real-world data.
- Urban100 still improves, but by a smaller margin, which is typical for geometry-heavy scenes where line stability matters as much as texture synthesis.

### Portrait Fidelity

For portrait enhancement, `face_v2_2x` is the model in this benchmark set that best balances clarity with natural skin texture.

| Model | Task | PSNR | SSIM | Practical Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `face_v2_2x` | Portrait enhance | **28.91** | **0.8148** | Preserves facial texture better and avoids an overly smooth result |

Interpretation:

- Use `face_v2_*` when realism, pores, wrinkles, eyelashes, and facial texture retention are important.
- Use `face_*` instead when the preferred output is softer and more beautified.

## How To Read These Results

Benchmark numbers are directional, not absolute guarantees for every input.

- PSNR is helpful for measuring reconstruction accuracy against a reference image.
- SSIM is helpful for judging structural similarity and perceptual consistency.
- In production use, visual quality should still be checked alongside metrics, especially for generative restoration models.

In practice:

- Choose `generative_*` when the image is heavily compressed, very blurry, or missing detail.
- Choose `high_fidelity_*` when the source is already fairly good and you want conservative enhancement.
- Choose `general_*` for standard non-face enhancement.
- Choose `face_v2_*` or `generative_portrait_*` for human subjects, depending on how degraded the source is.

## Dataset Notes

### DIV2K

Best for evaluating texture reconstruction and detail recovery on high-quality reference imagery.

### RealSR

Best for evaluating recovery on realistic degradation, including sensor noise and non-ideal capture conditions.

### Urban100

Best for evaluating architectural detail, repeated structures, and line stability.

## Visual Examples

### DIV2K: Extreme Generative Recovery

Focus: reconstructing complex textures under 4x upscaling.

## Model Selection Guidance

Use this page together with the API model list when selecting a model:

- For severe low-resolution image recovery: `generative_2x` or `generative_4x`
- For realistic portrait recovery: `face_v2_2x` or `face_v2_4x`
- For highly degraded portraits: `generative_portrait_1x`, `generative_portrait_2x`, or `generative_portrait_4x`
- For standard non-face enhancement: `general_2x` or `general_4x`
- For conservative upscaling of already good images: `high_fidelity_2x` or `high_fidelity_4x`
