# Introduction
Video restoration and super-resolution powered by AI.

## Overview
Welcome to our Video Enhancement API!

Our video processing services provide industrial-grade solutions for restoring and upscaling video content:

*   **Video Upscale:** Convert SD or HD footage to 4K Ultra HD clarity using deep convolution and feature learning technologies.
*   **Portrait Restoration:** specialized models to detect, stabilize, and enhance faces in video streams, removing motion blur and noise while maintaining identity.
*   **General Restoration:** A comprehensive solution based on GAN technology to de-noise, de-blur, and enhance details in general video content.
*   **Generative Reconstruction:** Utilizing Stable Diffusion for video to reconstruct textures and details in extremely low-quality footage.

Our video models focus on three core pillars:

*   **Temporal Stability:** Unlike image-only models, our video engines ensure smooth transitions between frames, eliminating flickering and jitter.
*   **Clarity:** Recovering fine details and removing compression artifacts common in streaming or legacy media.
*   **Performance:** Optimized inference times to handle heavy video processing workloads efficiently.

## Model Classes
Our Video API classifies models based on the restoration approach:

1.  **Restoration & Upscale (Standard):** Models like *Ultra HD* and *General Restore* focus on cleaning up the footage and increasing resolution without altering the fundamental content. They rely on pixel-perfect accuracy and temporal consistency.
2.  **Generative Video:** The *Generative Model* uses advanced logic-based reconstruction. It is designed for "impossible" restoration tasks where the source video lacks sufficient data, generating realistic textures and details to fill the gaps.

## Authentication

You will need an API key in order to make requests to this API. Make sure you never share your API key with anyone, and never commit it to a public repository.

Once you have your API key, set it as the `APIKEY` header of your requests.

*   **Don't have an API key?** Get started by [Purchasing an API Key Now](https://www.hitpaw.com/hitpaw-api.html).
*   **Already have your API Key?** Skip the local setup and test the API directly in your browser. [Explore Playground →](https://playground.hitpaw.com/)

## API Restrictions
*   **Rate Limits:** The API has access rate limits depending on the current load on the servers. If you receive an `HTTP 429` response, please try again soon. We recommend using an exponential backoff strategy for requests to avoid hitting the limit again.
*   **Protocol:** The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP will return an `HTTP 301` redirect.
