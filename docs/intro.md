# HitPaw AI 

Access the world's most powerful AI media enhancement models designed for professional scale. Our technology provides the "last-mile" solution for improving the quality of images and videos, trusted by industry leaders to deliver industrial-grade results for everything from vintage archives to modern user-generated content.

Our models excel at handling specific degradation types—including noise, blur, compression artifacts, and low resolution—to produce high-fidelity outcomes.

## 1. Image Enhancement Models

Our image models are categorized into two distinct classes to suit different needs: **Standard** (focusing on fidelity and accuracy) and **Generative** (focusing on creativity and reconstruction).

### Super-Resolution & Upscale
*   **General Enhance:** The go-to solution for 2x/4x upscaling in general scenarios. It balances noise reduction with detail generation, effectively handling the mixed-quality images found on social networks.
*   **High Fidelity:** Designed for high-quality source files. It upscales resolution while strictly preserving the original artistic intent and fine textures, avoiding the artificial "processed" look common in other upscalers.

### Portrait Optimization
*   **Portrait Clear (Soft):** A dual-purpose model that sharpens background details while applying a beautifying, soft-focus effect to facial features. Ideal for scenarios requiring a balance between clarity and aesthetics.
*   **Portrait Natural (Textured):** A V2 model built for realism. It prioritizes the recovery of high-fidelity skin textures (pores, grain), restoring faces with photographic accuracy rather than artificial smoothing.
*   **Generative Portrait:** Utilizes Diffusion technology to reconstruct faces in severely degraded or blurry photos, effectively generating plausible high-quality details where the original data is missing.

### Restoration (Denoise & Sharpen)
*   **Sharp & Detail Denoise:** Specialized 1x enhancement models that aggressively remove sensor noise and grain while pulling focus to the subject, ensuring crisp edges without introducing artifacts.

## 2. Video Enhancement Models

Video restoration requires a specialized approach utilizing **Temporal Stability**. Our video models ensure that enhancements are fused consistently across multiple frames to prevent flickering, jitter, and artifacts.

### Cinematic Upscaling
*   **Ultra HD Model:** The industry standard for converting SD/HD footage to 4K. It uses deep convolution to excavate fine details and smooth out jagged edges (aliasing), resulting in a clean, natural high-definition picture.

### Video Portrait Restoration
*   **Face Soft (Video):** Automatically detects and tracks faces in motion, applying stable skin smoothing and feature enhancement. It uses facial prior knowledge to beautify subjects while maintaining identity.
*   **Portrait Restore:** A heavy-duty repair model for blurry or noisy faces in video. It fuses data from continuous frames to reconstruct facial features (eyes, mouth) that are otherwise lost in motion blur.

### General Video Restoration
*   **General Restore:** A versatile GAN-based model designed for complex inputs. It simultaneously de-noises, de-blurs, and removes compression artifacts, making it ideal for remastering old clips or fixing low-bitrate internet videos.
*   **Generative Video:** Powered by Stable Diffusion, this model reconstructs textures and details in extremely low-quality footage, bridging the gap between restoration and creation to salvage unusable content.

## Core Advantages

*   **Quality:** Industry-defining results fit for professional use cases, from Hollywood studios to AAA game development.
*   **Fidelity:** Unlike generic filters, our models are trained to preserve the original identity of subjects and the authentic texture of surfaces.
*   **Versatility:** With both **Standard** (accurate) and **Generative** (creative) options, you can choose the exact tool needed for restoration vs. reconstruction workflows.
