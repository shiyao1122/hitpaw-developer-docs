# HitPaw API Documentation

Welcome to the HitPaw API documentation! Access the world's most powerful AI media enhancement models and specialized AI tools designed for professional scale. Our technology provides the "last-mile" solution for improving the quality of images and videos, trusted by industry leaders to deliver industrial-grade results.

Our models excel at handling specific degradation types—including noise, blur, compression artifacts, and low resolution—to produce high-fidelity outcomes.

## Image Enhancement Capabilities

Our image processing services offer world-class capabilities designed to handle a wide variety of restoration scenarios:

*   **Upscale:** Output high-resolution images from low-resolution input files using standard or high-fidelity models.
*   **Face Recovery:** Ensure high-quality facial details, offering both "Clear" (soft/beauty) and "Natural" (textured/realistic) restoration options.
*   **Sharpen & Denoise:** Bring images into focus by removing blur and sensor noise while preserving the original structure.
*   **Generative Restoration:** Leverage Diffusion technology to reconstruct details in severely degraded portraits or general images.

## Video Enhancement Capabilities

Our video processing services provide industrial-grade solutions for restoring and upscaling video content:

*   **Video Upscale:** Convert SD or HD footage to 4K Ultra HD clarity using deep convolution and feature learning technologies.
*   **Portrait Restoration:** specialized models to detect, stabilize, and enhance faces in video streams, removing motion blur and noise while maintaining identity.
*   **General Restoration:** A comprehensive solution based on GAN technology to de-noise, de-blur, and enhance details in general video content.
*   **Generative Reconstruction:** Utilizing Stable Diffusion for video to reconstruct textures and details in extremely low-quality footage.

## Core Advantages

*   **Quality:** Industry-defining results fit for professional use cases, from Hollywood studios to AAA game development.
*   **Fidelity:** Unlike generic filters, our models are trained to preserve the original identity of subjects and the authentic texture of surfaces.
*   **Versatility:** With both **Standard** (accurate) and **Generative** (creative) options, you can choose the exact tool needed for restoration vs. reconstruction workflows.
